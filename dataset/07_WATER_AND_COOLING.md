# Water and Cooling

> Project-specific water use cannot be inferred from the generic phrase “data center.” Cooling architecture, heat-rejection method, climate, electrical load, server utilization, water source, and operating assumptions materially change water demand.

## Core distinction: closed loop is not one single design

A closed internal coolant loop recirculates fluid through servers, cold plates, immersion systems, CDUs, chillers, or heat exchangers. That describes the **internal loop**, but it does not by itself prove that the entire facility consumes zero water.

External heat rejection can be:

- fully dry / air-cooled;
- evaporative;
- adiabatic or hybrid;
- connected to a cooling tower;
- connected to another heat sink.

Therefore, the useful Cascade questions are not merely “Is it closed loop?” but:

1. What carries heat away from the computing equipment?
2. How is that heat finally rejected outdoors?
3. Is any water evaporated during normal or peak-weather operation?
4. What is annual makeup-water use?
5. Is potable municipal water used?
6. What is peak-day use during hot weather?
7. What coolant is used and how is it contained?
8. What is discharged to sewer/stormwater, if anything?
9. What happens during drought or equipment failure?

## Simple Mining claims

Simple Mining's public water article states that its Iowa fleet uses closed-loop systems and claims very low water use, including a figure of approximately 300 gallons per year per 10 MW and no evaporative cooling in its systems. The company also discusses propylene-glycol coolant.

Those are **company statements about its operations**, not an independent engineering determination for Cascade. A Cascade approval process should request sealed design documents, actual WUE/makeup-water estimates, peak-day demand, source-water information, metering, leak detection, and independent review.

## Industry evidence: water use varies dramatically

A 2025 peer-reviewed Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory review found workload-level data-center water use can vary by more than four orders of magnitude. Important variables include server efficiency, utilization, cooling system, climate, grid water use, inactive equipment, and hardware-refresh cycle. This is strong evidence against applying one generic “gallons per data center” number to every project.

## Zero-water / dry-cooling examples

Microsoft announced a next-generation data-center cooling design using chip-level closed-loop cooling that it says consumes zero water for cooling during operation, aside from non-cooling administrative uses. This demonstrates technical feasibility for some modern designs; it is not evidence that Simple Mining's Cascade design uses Microsoft's architecture.

Supermicro markets closed-loop dry-cooler systems for data-center liquid cooling. Its materials describe dry heat rejection at multi-megawatt scale.

Chart Industries describes large closed-loop air-cooled heat exchangers/dry coolers as a method of dramatically reducing water compared with evaporative systems.

ThermoKey and EVAPCO publish dry-cooler and hybrid/adiabatic product information that illustrates the distinction between fully dry cooling and designs that add water under high-temperature conditions.

## Important terminology lesson

EVAPCO's technical material is particularly useful because it shows that a product can be called a **closed-circuit cooler** while still evaporating water on the outside of the closed process-fluid coil. Thus “closed circuit” and “zero water consumption” are not synonyms.

## Cascade policy implications

A defensible local standard should be based on measurable performance rather than a brand or marketing term. Potential requirements include:

- engineering narrative and diagram from IT load to outdoor heat rejection;
- expected annual, monthly, peak-day, and emergency water demand;
- water source and whether potable water is used;
- cooling-water and process-water metering;
- independent water-capacity/hydrology review;
- leak detection and chemical/coolant containment;
- drought curtailment plan;
- wastewater/blowdown disclosure;
- maximum project-wide annual water use;
- renewed review before a cooling-system change or expansion.

## What remains unknown for Cascade

Public sources reviewed for this dataset do not independently establish the proposed facility's:

- annual gallons/year;
- maximum gallons/day;
- peak hot-weather demand;
- final dry vs. adiabatic heat-rejection design;
- municipal-water demand;
- wastewater/blowdown volume;
- coolant inventory;
- drought-response plan.

These are appropriately treated as open questions, not assumptions.
